        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Abdi Diaz. I am from Santa Ana, California and I come from a Mexican heritage. I have been born and raised here in Santa Ana my whole life. I find myself to be very fortunate for the opportunities that I have received because my parents decided to come here so that they could give me and my siblings a chance at a better life. I am the oldest of 4 and I am a first generation college student. My parents have always motivated me to be the best I can be in everything that I do. I am grateful for them for always being my motivation as well as my inspiration. I say this because I have seen how hardworking they are and how they go out of their way so that my siblings and I have what we need and what sometimes we desire. They inspire me to be better so that I can make them proud and make their efforts worth it.<br><br>

        My aspirations are to be able to graduate college and play for the soccer team here at UCR. I consider myself a dedicated, hardworking, determined person. I have a great work ethic and aspire to be the best I can be every single day.  I know I have to make the most of my time every single day if I want to be able to be successful and accomplish my dreams. I have to minimize any distractions and stay focused on the goals that I have set for myself. I want to be a professional soccer player and I know that in order to be able to achieve that I have to work hard and improve every day. I want to be able to do the thing I love the most which is play soccer and be able to help my parents financially. I always want to improve every single aspect of my life and I want to learn from anyone and from my mistakes because I know that will help me improve.<br><br>

        My experiences overall have helped me mature as a person and value the things that I have. It has helped me realize that I should not take anything for granted and make the most of every opportunity I get because I may not get the chance to again. Being able to work has helped me gain experience of how to deal with any sorts of problems and people. It has helped me become more patient and it has made me realize that I want more than just working a minimum wage job. Being a student-athlete, and having a job has made me more responsible as well. I have learned how to manage my time more efficiently and stay on top of the things I need to do. I have knowledge of the struggles my parents go through because sometimes work can be difficult because of coworkers or customers and it just makes me appreciate what they do for me even more.
